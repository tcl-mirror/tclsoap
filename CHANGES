TclSOAP 1.5
-------------

Added support for asynchronous transports with the -command option to the
create and configure commands. If set to a callback procedure the callback
is called with the extracted RPC reply data: e.g: 
proc callback {data} { puts "$data"}
Support is provided in the HTTP transport code.

Made the http transport somewhat more backwardly compatible for tcl 8.0+

Added xmlrpc.test file.

Fixed bug in SOAP::configure from old -xmlrpc option.
Fixed bug in XMLRPC response parsing. values with no type are strings.
Fixed bug in error message for missing XMLRPC parameters.

TclSOAP 1.4
-----------

Added XML-RPC support using the same interface as that for SOAP methods.

Added XMLRPC::Domain package corresponding to the SOAP::Domain package
to provide a framework for XML-RPC services under the tclhttpd web
server.

Added XMLRPC::TypedVariable package to enable service writers to
provide type information back to the XML-RPC framework. This should be
extended to the SOAP package soon.

Added -replyProc and -postProc options the the SOAP::configure
command.  These enable post-processing of the raw XML reply
(-replyProc) or the parsed reply (-postProc) via a specified procedure.

Re-arranged the internals to permit methods with the same name but in
different tcl namespaces to be defined.

Added tests to soap.test for the post-processing feature.

Added more extensive comments to the source code.

TclSOAP 1.3
-----------

Added the SOAP::Domain package to provide support for SOAP services
under tclhttpd. See doc/SOAPURLDomain.html for details.

Fixes and improvements to the SOAP::Parse package.

Fixes to the SOAP::xpath package. This package will be depreciated in
favour of Steve Ball's XPath exensions to TclDOM 2.0. 

Some adjustments to ensure the code runs with xml and dom 2.0 packages.

Added a samples directory and moved the SOAP-tests file.

Added a tests subdirectory. As shipped, TclSOAP 1.3 passes all the
tests using xml 2.0 and dom 2.0. (Note I am not using xml::c). I am
interested in receiving bug reports and feature requests if they are
accompanied by a test.

TclSOAP1.2
----------

Added SOAP::cget procedure.

Updated to use the new SOAP::xpath namespace (to avoid xml 2.0's xpath)

Various bug fixes.

TclSOAP 1.1
-----------

Changed the create command to work on the tcl procedure name and added a -name option to replace the -alias option. This avoids tcl namespace clashes.

Added some Fault processing using my xpath package.

TclSOAP 1.0
-----------

Initial release.
