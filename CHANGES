* TclSOAP 1.6.2
---------------

** Implemented SOAP Version support - TODO: Test
   SOAP::configure now has a -version option taking the uri of the
   SOAP envelope namespace.

** Implemented SOAP Encoding support - TODO: Test
   SOAP::configure now has a -encoding option taking the uri of the
   SOAP encoding namespace.

** General method attribute support
   Added a -attribute option to the SOAP method call code to allow the
   user to add additional attributes to the method element. Required for
   UDDI support.

** Debug Messages
   Use the tcllib log module for any debug messages so they can be
   turned off by judicious use of SOAP::configure -logLevel

** Applied modified patch #458851
   Enhanced XMLRPC::reply to cope with multiple reply parameters. 
   Added implementation of parse_xmlrpc_request to the SOAP.tcl file.

* TclSOAP 1.6.1
---------------

** Client SOAP types
  Ammended SOAP.tcl::inset_value to only apply xml namespace qualifiers
  to values if a namespace is provided

** validator tests
   Improved the type checking of the manyTypesTest and echoStructTest.

** XML Namespace support for SOAP Types
   Implemented a scheme for specifiying the namespace of a user
   defined type. See interop/soapinterop.tcl

** Removed SOAP::Parse
   This package is no longer used. We only require TclDOM and if the
   dom::c package is in use we do not require the xml package.

** Structure bounds checking
   simon@e-ppraisal.com implemented boundary checks for structure
   assignments in SOAP.tcl

** SOAP:Header support
   Implemented Header support as a -header option to the SOAP command
   for client code and attached to the rpcvar result of a server
   procedure. See interop/soapinteropC.tcl for an example of client usage
   and cgi-bin/soap/soapinterop.tcl:echoVoid for the server code.

** SOAP Element Attributes
   We allow attaching of additional attributes to XML elements via the
   rpcvar -attribute option. interop/soapinteropC.tcl:validate.emsr:header 
   has an example. This can be use to implement the Transaction example
   from the SOAP spec eg:
     return [rpcvar -header [list Transaction [rpcvar Transaction 5]]

** dom::c 2.0 Support
   Various fixes to support the TclDOM 2.0 C package.

** SOAPAction HTTP header
   Fix to SOAPAction handling to follow spec.

* TclSOAP 1.6
-------------

** SOAP interoperability testing
  We now pass the Userland SOAP and XML-RPC validation suite at
  http://validate.soapware.org/ and http://validate.xmlrpc.com/. We also
  provide an implementation of the SOAP Interoperability Lab Round 1 test
  suite and pass these tests too.

** CGI server code added.
  This has been tested under Apache httpd.
  TclHTTPD support is now implemented via the CGI package - see the
  samples/tclserver.tcl script for an example.

** rpcvar package
  Dumped XMLRPC::TypedVariable in favour of rpcvar::* because it's a
  lot more simple to type. Fixed the methods so we can reasonably
  import the names into other namespaces. Implemented 'typedef' for
  defining complex SOAP types.

** Type Recognition.
  Numerous enhancements to the SOAP parameter type recognition especially
  for structs and for structs of structs.

** Numerous patches and bug fixes applied.

** Checked against TclXML 2.1theta with TclDOM 2.0

* TclSOAP 1.5.1
---------------

** Bug fixes for HTTP transport problems.

* TclSOAP 1.5
-------------

Added support for asynchronous transports with the -command option to the
create and configure commands. If set to a callback procedure the callback
is called with the extracted RPC reply data: e.g: 
proc callback {data} { puts "$data"}
Support is provided in the HTTP transport code.

Made the http transport somewhat more backwardly compatible for tcl 8.0+

Added xmlrpc.test file.

Fixed bug in SOAP::configure from old -xmlrpc option.
Fixed bug in XMLRPC response parsing. values with no type are strings.
Fixed bug in error message for missing XMLRPC parameters.

* TclSOAP 1.4
-------------

Added XML-RPC support using the same interface as that for SOAP methods.

Added XMLRPC::Domain package corresponding to the SOAP::Domain package
to provide a framework for XML-RPC services under the tclhttpd web
server.

Added XMLRPC::TypedVariable package to enable service writers to
provide type information back to the XML-RPC framework. This should be
extended to the SOAP package soon.

Added -replyProc and -postProc options the the SOAP::configure
command.  These enable post-processing of the raw XML reply
(-replyProc) or the parsed reply (-postProc) via a specified procedure.

Re-arranged the internals to permit methods with the same name but in
different tcl namespaces to be defined.

Added tests to soap.test for the post-processing feature.

Added more extensive comments to the source code.

* TclSOAP 1.3
-------------

Added the SOAP::Domain package to provide support for SOAP services
under tclhttpd. See doc/SOAPURLDomain.html for details.

Fixes and improvements to the SOAP::Parse package.

Fixes to the SOAP::xpath package. This package will be depreciated in
favour of Steve Ball's XPath exensions to TclDOM 2.0. 

Some adjustments to ensure the code runs with xml and dom 2.0 packages.

Added a samples directory and moved the SOAP-tests file.

Added a tests subdirectory. As shipped, TclSOAP 1.3 passes all the
tests using xml 2.0 and dom 2.0. (Note I am not using xml::c). I am
interested in receiving bug reports and feature requests if they are
accompanied by a test.

* TclSOAP 1.2
-------------

Added SOAP::cget procedure.

Updated to use the new SOAP::xpath namespace (to avoid xml 2.0's xpath)

Various bug fixes.

* TclSOAP 1.1
-------------

Changed the create command to work on the tcl procedure name and added a -name option to replace the -alias option. This avoids tcl namespace clashes.

Added some Fault processing using my xpath package.

* TclSOAP 1.0
-------------

Initial release.
