TclSOAP 1.4
-----------

Added XML-RPC support using the same interface as that for SOAP methods.

Added -replyProc and -postProc options the the SOAP::configure
command.  These enable post-processing of the raw XML reply
(-replyProc) or the parsed reply (-postProc) via a specified procedure.

Added tests to soap.test for the post-processing feature.

TclSOAP 1.3
-----------

Added the SOAP::Domain package to provide support for SOAP services
under tclhttpd. See doc/SOAPURLDomain.html for details.

Fixes and improvements to the SOAP::Parse package.

Fixes to the SOAP::xpath package. This package will be depreciated in
favour of Steve Ball's XPath exensions to TclDOM 2.0. 

Some adjustments to ensure the code runs with xml and dom 2.0 packages.

Added a samples directory and moved the SOAP-tests file.

Added a tests subdirectory. As shipped, TclSOAP 1.3 passes all the
tests using xml 2.0 and dom 2.0. (Note I am not using xml::c). I am
interested in receiving bug reports and feature requests if they are
accompanied by a test.

TclSOAP1.2
----------

Added SOAP::cget procedure.

Updated to use the new SOAP::xpath namespace (to avoid xml 2.0's xpath)

Various bug fixes.

TclSOAP 1.1
-----------

Changed the create command to work on the tcl procedure name and added a -name option to replace the -alias option. This avoids tcl namespace clashes.

Added some Fault processing using my xpath package.

TclSOAP 1.0
-----------

Initial release.
