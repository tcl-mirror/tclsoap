  <a name="introduction"><h2>Introduction</h2></a>

  <p>The <tt>SOAP::CGI</tt> package allows you to provide SOAP web
  services from Tcl scripts via the CGI script capabilities of your
  web server. This document describes the use of this package with the
  Apache httpd server but the package should be applicable to any
  other server supporting the Common Gateway Interface.</p>

  <p>The package provides a fairly comprehensive framework to deal with
  hiding the details of the web service protocols. The Tcl scripts
  implementing the service need to know nothing of XML nor the RPC
  protocol in use. Errors are returned via the normal Tcl error
  mechanism. The only special feature needed is variable type
  hinting. It is not possible to distingush between a string with
  whitespace and a list in Tcl, so the <tt>XMLRPC::TypedVariable</tt> package
  is used to provide the additional type information when required.</p>

  <a name="installation"><h2>Installation</h2></a>

  <p>Installation really only requires placing a script into the http
  servers cgi-bin directory and writing some service
  implementations. A generic script is provided as
  <tt>cgi-bin/rpc</tt> with some example services in
  <tt>cgi-bin/soap</tt>. The package has three variables to configure
  so that it can find the service implementations:

  <table border="0" align="bottom" cellpadding="1" cellspacing = "0"
           bgcolor="#c0c0c0"><tr><td align="left">
    <tt>package require SOAP::CGI<br>
    set SOAP::CGI::soapdir   <font color="red">"../method-scripts"</font><br>
    set SOAP::CGI::xmlrpcdir <font color="red">"../method-scripts"</font><br>
    set SOAP::CGI::logfile   <font color="red">"../logs/rpc.log"</font><br>
    SOAP::CGI::main<br></tt>
  </td></tr></table>

  The SOAP and XML-RPC implementations can be the same, as above, or
  placed into separate directories. The log file is optional (unset
  the variable to disable logs) and will need to be writable by the
  httpd user - this usually means it needs to be world writable.</p>

  <p>The script needs to be able to execute using tcl 8.3 or
  better and needs to be able to find the TclSOAP package. Bear in
  mind that the httpd process will not run with your environment
  (unless you are working on Windows). The supplied script shows how
  you can set the location of the package, should you need to. If you
  are using the Windows Apache server then you can't set the
  environment before <tt>exec</tt>ing tclsh so you need to manipulate
  the <tt>auto_path</tt> variable from within the CGI script instead.</p>

  <a name="implementation"><h2>Writing Service Implementations</h2></a>
  <p>Upon receipt of an HTTP POST the CGI framework examines the data
  and decides which RPC protocol should handle the request. The
  handlers then retrieve the method name from the request and look for
  a file with this name in the configured directory. This is sourced
  and then evaluated with the arguments obtained from the POST
  data. For example, the implementation for the <tt>square</tt>
  service will be the file <tt>../method-scripts/square</tt> with the
  following code:

  <table border="0" align="bottom" cellpadding="1" cellspacing = "0"
           bgcolor="#c0c0c0"><tr><td align="left">
  <pre>proc square {num} {
    return [expr $num * $num]
}</pre>
  </td></tr></table>

  Given the configuration shown above, this implementation will be
  used for both SOAP and XML-RPC requests to the <tt>square</tt>
  service.</p>

  <p>For more complex types such as structs, the reply will need to be
  an XMLRPC::TypedVariable so that the RPC handler can package the
  result correctly. So the implementation of the <tt>platform</tt>
  service which returns a struct containing the
  <tt>::tcl_platform</tt> variable information is as follows

  <table border="0" align="bottom" cellpadding="1" cellspacing = "0"
           bgcolor="#c0c0c0"><tr><td align="left">
  <pre>package require XMLRPC::TypedVariable
proc platform {} {
    return [XMLRPC::TypedVariable struct [array get ::tcl_platform]]
}</pre>
  </td></tr></table></p>

  <p>Structs are passed to the implementing procedure as a list of
  name value pairs suitable for use with <tt>array set
  ...</tt>, arrays are passed in as Tcl lists and everything else is
  passed in as a string. If the result type cannot be guessed then you
  should return a typed variable otherwise it will be assumed to be a
  string. The only types that can be guessed are integer, double and boolean
  (if expressed with <tt>true</tt> or <tt>false</tt>).</p>

  <p>Look in the <tt>cgi-bin/soap</tt> subdirectory in the TclSOAP
  distribution for some examples of service implementations. There is
  an implementation of the <a href="http://validator.soapware.org/">UserLand
   SOAP interoperability suite</a> that is
  used to ensure the package conforms to this standard. These
  illustrate the use of arrays and structs fairly comprehensively.</p>
