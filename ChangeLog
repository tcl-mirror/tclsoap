	* SOAP-service.tcl (SOAP::Service::base64_service): Resolved the
	  remaining problemzone by rewriting the xpath invokation to a
	  selectNode node call followed by use of the new accessor
	  'getSimpleElementValue' to perform the parts of xpath call the
	  selectNode doesn't do on its own, to make the whole sequence
	  equivalent. The SOAP::xpath dependency is no more.

	* SOAP.tcl (::SOAP::insert_headers): Resolved the remaining
	  problem zone through use of the new 'documentElement' accessor
	  command.

	* utils.tcl: Created two additional accessors (documentElement,
	  getSimpleElementValue), and fixed typos in the new internal
	  'IsElement' and 'Parent' acessors.

	* SOAP-domain.tcl: Removed dependency on TclDOM and changed all
	* pkgIndex.tcl: TclDOM accesses over to SOAP::Utils
	  commands. Moved the package to version 1.4.1. No problemzones.

	* SOAP-CGI.tcl: Removed dependency on TclDOM and changed all
	* pkgIndex.tcl: TclDOM accesses over to SOAP::Utils
	  commands. Moved the package to version 1.0.1. No problemzones.

	* XMLRPC.tcl: Removed dependency on TclDOM and changed all TclDOM
	* pkgIndex.tcl: accesses over to SOAP::Utils commands. Moved the
	  package to version 1.0.1. No problemzones.

	* SOAP.tcl: Removed dependency on TclDOM and changed all TclDOM
	* pkgIndex.tcl: accesses over to SOAP::Utils commands. Moved the
	  package to version 1.6.7.1. One problemzone remains right now:
	  The access to -documentElement in 'insert_headers', this code
	  has not been not converted yet due to not fully understanding
	  what it does.

	* SOAP-service.tcl: Removed dependency on TclDOM and changed all
	* pkgIndex.tcl: TclDOM accesses over to SOAP::Utils commands. Only
	  one problem- zone remains right now: The use of 'SOAP::xpath' in
	  'base64_service'. Moved the package to version 0.5.

	* utils.tcl: Added a number of DOM accessors missing from the
	* pkgIndex.tcl: package (document construction, destruction,
	  conversion from and to XML, node/attribute creation). Light
	  internal cleanup, i.e. a number of procedures could and now do
	  use abstract dom accessors instead of using direct DOM
	  commands. Moved the package to version 1.1.
