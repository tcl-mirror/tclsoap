	* utils.tcl: Added a number of DOM accessors missing from the
	* pkgIndex.tcl: package (document construction, destruction,
	  conversion from and to XML, node/attribute creation). Light
	  internal cleanup, i.e. a number of procedures could and now do
	  use abstract dom accessors instead of using direct DOM
	  commands. Moved package to version 1.1.
