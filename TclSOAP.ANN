Announcing a SOAP binding for Tcl 8.3

I recently got interested in SOAP and was using Tcl to try out some of
the SOAP servers listed by www.xmethods.net. After looking around I
have failed to spot any Tcl implementations of SOAP so I am providing
this one.

The Tcl SOAP package is written entirely in Tcl and uses the xml and
dom packages by Steve Ball of www.zveno.com. The package provides a
fairly simple binding of a Tcl command procedure to a SOAP method
call. For instance, the XMethods getTemp method can be called from Tcl
using:

% set temp [getTemp 90810]
41.0

For more information go to 
http://www.zsplat.freeserve.co.uk/soap1.0/doc/TclSOAP.html
and the package is at
http://www.zsplat.freeserve.co.uk/TclSOAP-1.0.tar.gz

This Tcl SOAP package has been tested only with Tcl 8.3, xml 1.2 and
dom 1.6 on Linux and on Windows (98 and 2000).
